# About Labeling

For every bitcoin transaction you send and receive, it is important to identify who is observing that transaction. The label serves the purpose of making sure that we are aware of who is sending us coins and who we are sending them to. Bitcoin transactions being public, we want to avoid as much as possible revealing our transaction history to anyone that might be keeping track of us.

So for example, if you receive bitcoin as payment for a job you completed, you can write “Bull Bitcoin pay”.

Now, if you want to send coins to someone else, you can use the same coin with the “Bull Bitcoin” label if you wish to sell them on the Bull Bitcoin platform and add the label “Bull Bitcoin sold”, since it is the same observer of that coin, ie. Bull Bitcoin. If however, you wish to purchase something and you do not want your employer to know about it, then you would use a different coin that they are not capable of observing the transaction history.

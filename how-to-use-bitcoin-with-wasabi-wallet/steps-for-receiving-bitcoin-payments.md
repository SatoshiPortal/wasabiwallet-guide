# Steps for receiving Bitcoin payments

1. Go to the Receive tab.
2. Generate a Bitcoin address
3. Wasabi Wallet will ask you for a label. You should write what the payment is for or who it is from to keep track of your transactions.
4. Once generated, the address is automatically copied to your clipboard.
   * You can use the dropdown menu to see the QR code and other address details.
   * Right click on the address to save the QR code, copy the address, hide the address or edit the label.
5. Share this Bitcoin address with whoever you want to receive a payment from.
6. Once the payment is received, it will appear in the "Transactions tab" and will also appear in your available balance on the "Send" tab.

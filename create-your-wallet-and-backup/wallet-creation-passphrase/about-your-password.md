* Write down the passphrase you want to use before entering it in your computer.

* Use at least 12 characters in your passphrase, 24 characters offer more security.
* The password / passphrase is required every time you want to use the app.

* Ideally, create a unique passphrase that nobody can guess but that you can remember.
* If you lose the passphrase, you lose access to your Bitcoin forever.
* You cannot change your passphrase. If you want to change your passphrase, you will have to start the process all over again.
* The passphrase is required to recover your access to your Bitcoin if your computer is damaged, lost or stolen.

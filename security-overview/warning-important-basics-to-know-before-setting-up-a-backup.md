# WARNING! Important basics to know before setting up a backup

## ⛔️ <mark style="color:red;">T</mark><mark style="color:red;">**HIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. TAKE A MINUTE TO READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST. DO NOT SKIP. ⛔️**</mark>

The next step involves creating a paper backup of your Bitcoin wallet, which you will need to recover access to your Bitcoin if your computer is damaged, lost or stolen.

The backup consists of a series of words generated randomly by the Bitcoin wallet.

**These words, in combination with your password, allow you to recover access to the keys of your Bitcoin wallet in case you lose them.**

### <mark style="color:red;">**There are 5 rules to making a Bitcoin backup;**</mark>

1. If you do not have a backup and you lose access to the Wasabi Wallet on your computer, you will lose access to the Bitcoin permanently.
2. If you have a backup but you forget the password, you will lose access to the Bitcoin permanently.
3. If someone finds the backup of your wallet, they cannot steal your money unless they also know your password.
4. Never store your password in the same place as your backup. If someone finds the backup and they also know your passphrase, they will be able to take your bitcoin.

# How can you lose your Bitcoin?

Although Wasabi Wallet is on your computer, the risks of losing funds by getting hacked are very low, unless you are specifically targeted by a highly skilled attacker. The most common causes of people losing their bitcoin are the following:

* Someone finds your backup and password.
  * This is even easier if you store them together. This person is often someone in your close surroundings.&#x20;
* You leave your computer open and someone has access to your password.&#x20;
* You forget your password.&#x20;
* Your computer stops working or you lose it and you are missing either your backup or your password.&#x20;
* You brag about your holdings and someone attempts to take them from you through coercive means.

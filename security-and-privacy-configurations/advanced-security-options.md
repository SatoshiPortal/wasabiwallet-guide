# Advanced Security Options

Wasabi Wallet offers several advanced options that will greatly improve the security of your funds and your privacy.

### Privacy Mode

When enabled, sensitive transaction and wallet information are hidden from physical observers. You can activate or deactivate by clicking the eye icon on the Wallet Explorer header in the top right corner.&#x20;

* The wallet remains usable.
* Any information that you expand in the wallet will be revealed, Privacy Mode only offers surface level protection.

### Lock Screen

This feature allows you to lock your wallet while it is running or stop it from being viewed. You unlock it using a PIN that you specify when activating the feature:

1. In the Settings tab, go to the Lock Screen section.&#x20;
2. Choose and enter a numerical PIN up to 10 digits in length in the PIN box, and click on Set.

#### **There are two ways to lock your screen:**

1. Hit Ctrl-L on your keyboard.&#x20;
2. On the top left menu bar, click on File, then Lock Screen.

This feature only locks the interface, it is not a fail-safe lock on your wallet. Anyone with the knowledge of the PIN can circumvent this feature.

### Connect to your own full node&#x20;

Connecting to your own node enables you to fetch information from it that Wasabi would otherwise fetch from external sources. Using Wasabi this way should give you more confidence about your privacy, because it simplifies some otherwise complex mechanisms. This is also your means of transacting without restrictions and for avoiding being defrauded. It's important to note that Wasabi's full node integration is still in experimental status.

#### **On the main menu, go to Tools, then Settings**

There are three different ways of using your Bitcoin full node with Wasabi:&#x20;

1. If you already have a full node on your computer, Wasabi will detect it.
2. You can connect to a remote node by specifying the local network IP address or Tor onion.&#x20;
   * Enter the node IP address under “Alternative Block Source for Main”
3. You can start Bitcoin Knots in Wasabi wallet to begin downloading and running your own node on your computer
